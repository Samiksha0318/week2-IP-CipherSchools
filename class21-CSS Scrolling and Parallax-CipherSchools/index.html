        <h2>Paragraph</h2>
        <p>
            A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic.
            Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central,
            unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.
            <br>

            Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the
            thesis is the main point of the essay, the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, 
            a topic sentence has a unifying function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified
            if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. 
            Note: Not all paragraphs need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs,
            generally don’t have topic sentences.

            This topic sentence forecasts the central idea or main point of the paragraph: “politicians” and “journalists” rely on Twitter. 
            The rest of the paragraph will focus on these two Twitter-user groups, thereby fulfilling the promise made by the topic sentence. 
            By avoiding irrelevant information that does not relate to the topic sentence, you can compose a unified paragraph.

            Often, the body paragraph demonstrates and develops your topic sentence through an ordered, logical progression of ideas. There are a 
            number of useful techniques for expanding on topic sentences and developing your ideas in a paragraph. Illustration in a paragraph 
            supports a general statement by means of examples, details, or relevant quotations (with your comments).

            A comparison or a contrast paragraph zeroes in on a key similarity or difference between, for instance, two sources, positions, or 
            ideas. Decide whether to deal only with similarities or only with differences, or to cover both. Also, keep in mind that a single 
            comparison can be spread out over two separate paragraphs. As the following topic sentence indicates, you should make your intention 
            clear to readers from the outset.A qualification paragraph acknowledges that what you previously asserted is not absolutely true or 
            always applicable.
